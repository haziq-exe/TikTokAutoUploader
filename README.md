## ⚙️ Pre-requisites

1. **Node.js:** You must have Node.js installed on your system, as some parts of this package rely on JavaScript code. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

   - **Note:** The necessary JavaScript dependencies (`playwright`,`playwright-extra`, `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth`) will be AUTOMATICALLY installed the first time you run the function, so you don't need to install them manually. Make sure that `npm` (Node.js package manager) is available in your system's PATH.


2. **Browser Binaries:** If you don't have them already, you'll need to install the browser binaries for `playwright`. This library uses chromium and firefox.

     to do so, just run the following command AFTER installing the package:
        
    ```bash
    python -m playwright install
    ```
